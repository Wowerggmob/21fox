subtitle: "Our company is involved in the real estate industry and resort
  amenities are relatively promising. Real estate: First, the acceleration of
  urbanization. The rapid economic development and continuous advancement of
  industrialization will accelerate the urbanization process of a region and a
  country, which will inevitably lead to the migration of a large number of
  rural population to urban areas, thus bringing about a huge demand for real
  estate. Second, investment demand. The real estate itself has not only social
  attributes and commodity attributes, but also certain investment attributes.
  In the current situation of China's relatively narrow investment channels,
  real estate investment is still the lowest risk, the most stable benefits of
  the industry. Therefore, a considerable part of investment funds is invested
  in real estate in the short or long term to promote the continuous development
  of real estate. Third, the increase of the demand for improvement. With the
  development of economy, the area and supporting facilities of some urban
  residents have been unable to meet their existing needs, so there will be a
  demand for new house purchase. This part of the demand is also an important
  factor driving the development of real estate. Resort amenities: Nowadays,
  more and more people pay attention to environmental protection. How to develop
  economy on the basis of environmental protection is a big problem. Resort is
  based on the purpose of environmental protection, harmony between man and
  nature to develop. Creating a green resort not only establishes a good image
  of the company concerned about the environment, but also effectively uses
  resources to reduce costs, which is conducive to the guests, enterprises,
  society and sustainable development of the only way. Through the agricultural
  resources of tourism development, to provide tourists sightseeing, tasting,
  purchase, study, entertainment, recreation, vacation and a series of services,
  can obtain higher economic income, will be conducive to the economic and
  technological cooperation and exchanges, promote regional economic
  development, the basis of introduction of capital, technology, talent, also
  helps to cultivate and expand the market, improve the public awareness of the
  local products, increase sales channels."
